The docs for this project are written in LaTeX.  You need the following
packages to compile docs into a PDF:

 * texlive-latex-base
 * texlive-extra-utils
 * texlive-latex-extra

On Ubuntu and similar distributions, you can type:

 * apt intsall texlive-latex-base texlive-extra-utils texlive-latex-extra

Someone should provide equivalent instructions for other distributions...
