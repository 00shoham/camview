* Sometimes camview seems to launch duplicate ffmpeg jobs.  Perhaps when
  one has wedged for a while.  Ensure we kill the old one before starting a
  new one.

* It seems that it's not a child process.  Perhaps the main process
  crashes, is restarted, but children of teh old main process remain?
  Best to check with "ps" command and kill old children.
