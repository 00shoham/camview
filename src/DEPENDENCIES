You need the following packages:

  * gcc
    (apt install gcc)
  * make
    (apt install make)
  * libjpeg
    (apt install libjpeg-dev)
  * ffmpeg
    (apt install ffmpeg)

You also need to install https://github.com/00shoham/idanlib.

Once you've got and built that, you will need to modify Makefile
to specify the path to src/ in that repo.  A bunch of utility
fucntions from there are used here.
